FormPlayer (test)
===========

FormPlayer is a RESTful XForm entry service written on the [Spring Framework](https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/).
Given a [user restore](https://confluence.dimagi.com/display/commcarepublic/OTA+Restore+API) and
an [XForm](http://dimagi.github.io/xform-spec/) FormPlayer enables form entry via JSON calls and responses (detailed below).
These files will often be hosted by a [CommCareHQ](https://www.github.com/dimagi/commcare-hq) server instance. Formplayer relies on the [CommCare](https://www.github.com/dimagi/commcare-core) libraries (included as subrepositories). Formplayer is built via gradle (wrapper files included).

### Dependencies
+ Formplayer caches session instances via Redis
+ Formplayer stores session instances via Postgres
+ Formplayer builds SQLite database for each restored user

Building and Running
------------
Clone formplayer repository

    $ git clone https://github.com/dimagi/formplayer.git

Download submodule dependencies

    $ git submodule update --init --recursive

To make properties file:

    $ cp config/application.example.properties config/application.properties  # Update properties as necessary (the defaults are fine for running locally)

In particular, make sure the `server.port` value is the same as the port from `FORMPLAYER_URL` in commcarehq's `localsettings.py`.

Make sure you have the formplayer database created. You will be asked to provide a password after running this command; assuming you are running formplayer locally, you should use the password for the postgres user associated with the locally-running instance of commcare hq (which can be found in the `DATABASES` section of your `localsettings.py` file).

    $ createdb formplayer -U commcarehq -h localhost  # Update connection info as necessary (the defaults are fine for running locally)

If you are running postgres in Docker, you may need to run this in the docker shell, using `./scripts/docker bash postgres` from the commcarehq repository.

To run (with tests):

    $ ./gradlew build && java -jar build/libs/formplayer.jar

To run without tests:

    $ ./gradlew assemble && java -jar build/libs/formplayer.jar

To test:

    $ ./gradlew test

    # to run a single test
    $ ./gradlew :test --tests tests.NewFormTests.testNewForm

    # to run in continuous mode
    $ ./gradlew test -t

When building on Linux it is sometimes necessary to run:

    $ gradle wrapper

### Running in IntelliJ

In order to set breakpoints, step through code, and link the runtime with source you'll need to run the code in an IDE. We use IntelliJ. To setup

1. Download [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac)
2. Open IntelliJ and select "Import Project"
3. Navigate to the cloned `formplayer` repository and select `build.gradle` at the root
4. De-select "Use auto-import" and "Create directories for empty content roots automatically" and *select* "Use gradle wrapper"
5. Click "OK"

After following these steps IntelliJ may need further configuration to work smoothly with Gradle.

Note: You can also use Android Studio as your IDE and follow the same steps as above.

#### Keeping your application.properties up to date

Properties are occasionally added to application.example.properties that will be required to run on the latest version.

If you experience an error after updating, try running

```bash
diff -u config/application{.example,}.properties
```

Lines your file is missing will begin with a `-`.

### Running in Docker

If you want to run FormPlayer in Docker as a service of CommCare HQ, follow these steps from your commcare-hq repository:

1. Check if you are on a Mac. If you are, don't bother with this. Just follow the [directions above](https://github.com/dimagi/formplayer#building-and-running).
2. Start Docker for CommCare HQ as usual, either with `scripts/docker up` (services only) or `scripts/docker runserver` (HQ and services).
3. Run `scripts/get_webhost` and append its output to `/etc/hosts`. (Or if you run Linux, `scripts/get_webhost | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`.)
4. If you run CommCare HQ in Django locally:
   1. Update localsettings.py with `FORMPLAYER_URL = 'http://localhost:8010'` and `BASE_ADDRESS = 'webhost:8000'`
   2. Start Django with `./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`.
5. From now on, open your local HQ instance at [http://webhost:8000/](http://webhost:8000/) (This is so that FormPlayer can use the same URL from inside its Docker container.)


### Contributing

For PRs that just modify code in the Formplayer repo, submit a PR to Formplayer on a separate branch.


#### Contributing changes to commcare

Formplayer also has a dependency on the commcare-core repository. The commcare-core `master` branch is not
stable and Formplayer uses a different branch. The submodule repo `libs/commcare` should always be pointing to
the `formplayer` branch.

#### Updating the CommCare version

When updating Formplayer to have a new release of a CommCare version (e.g. 2.34 to 2.35), a PR should be opened from the `commcare_X.Y` branch into
the `formplayer` branch. Once QA has been finished, merge the PR and update the Formplayer submodule.


### Docs
____________

We automatically generate API documentation using the Swagger plug-in [SpringFox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)
for Spring. To view the generated docs, run the server (above) and navigate to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/ (changing
host and port as appropriate)
